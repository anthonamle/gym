        <h2>General Terms</h2>
        <p>Here you will find explanations of common gym terms and concepts, their importance, and how to use them to build muscle.</p>
        
        <h3>RIR (Reps In Reserve)</h3>
        <p>RIR stands for Reps In Reserve, which refers to the number of repetitions you can still perform before reaching failure. It helps in gauging the intensity of your workout.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> RIR is crucial for managing workout intensity and avoiding overtraining. It allows you to push your limits safely and effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Use:</strong> To use RIR, estimate how many more reps you could perform before failure. For example, if you stop at 8 reps but could have done 2 more, your RIR is 2.</p>
        <p><strong>RIR 1 and RIR 0:</strong> RIR 1 means you have one rep left in the tank before failure, while RIR 0 means you have reached failure. RIR 1 is often used for strength training, while RIR 0 is used for hypertrophy.</p>
        
        <h3>Failure/Close to Failure</h3>
        <p>Training to failure means performing an exercise until you cannot complete another repetition with good form. Close to failure means stopping just short of this point.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Training to failure maximizes muscle recruitment and growth. It ensures that you are pushing your muscles to their limits.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Use:</strong> Use failure training sparingly to avoid overtraining. Incorporate it into your routine for specific sets or exercises to maximize muscle growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Difference Between Failure and RIR:</strong> Failure means you cannot perform another rep, while RIR indicates how many reps you have left before failure. Both are used to gauge workout intensity and ensure effective training.</p>
        
        <h3>Mechanical Tension</h3>
        <p>Mechanical tension refers to the force generated by muscles during resistance training. It is one of the primary drivers of muscle growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Mechanical tension is essential for muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. It stimulates muscle fibers and promotes growth.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Use:</strong> To maximize mechanical tension, focus on lifting heavy weights with proper form. Ensure that you are progressively overloading your muscles over time.</p>
        
        <h3>Hypertrophy</h3>
        <p>Hypertrophy is the increase in muscle size due to resistance training. It is achieved by creating micro-tears in muscle fibers, which then repair and grow stronger.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Hypertrophy is important for building muscle mass and improving overall strength and aesthetics.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Reach Hypertrophy:</strong> To achieve hypertrophy, focus on progressive overload, proper nutrition, and adequate rest. Incorporate a variety of exercises, rep ranges, and training intensities into your routine.</p>
        
        <h3>Full Range of Motion vs. Partial Reps</h3>
        <p>Full range of motion (ROM) involves moving a joint through its entire range during an exercise, while partial reps involve moving through only a portion of the range.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of Full ROM:</strong> Maximizes muscle activation, improves flexibility, and ensures balanced muscle development.</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Full ROM:</strong> Can be more challenging and may require lighter weights to maintain proper form.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of Partial Reps:</strong> Allows for heavier weights, targets specific parts of the muscle, and can be used to overcome sticking points.</p>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of Partial Reps:</strong> May lead to imbalanced muscle development and reduced flexibility if overused.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Use:</strong> Incorporate both full ROM and partial reps into your training. Use full ROM for overall muscle development and partial reps to target specific areas or overcome plateaus.</p>
